## üîó Blockchain Integration Status

### 1. ‚úÖ **Merchant Registration** (COMPLETE)
**File:** `lib/features/auth/merchant_auth_screen.dart`

**Flow:**
1. User enters business details (name, category, location)
2. Connects wallet (private key stored securely)
3. Calls `ContractService.registerMerchant()`
4. Signs transaction with private key
5. Submits to MerchantRegistry contract
6. Returns blockchain transaction hash
7. Saves merchant ID (wallet address) locally

**Smart Contract Call:**
```dart
contractService.registerMerchant(
  privateKeyHex: privateKey,
  businessName: "Caf√© Bliss",
  category: "Food & Beverage",
  location: "Mumbai",
)
```

**Contract Function:**
```solidity
function registerMerchant(
    string memory _businessName,
    string memory _category,
    string memory _location
) external
```

**Verification:** ‚úÖ Parameters match, transaction signed, hash returned

---

### 2. ‚úÖ **Payment Processing** (COMPLETE)
**File:** `lib/features/payment/payment_confirmation_screen.dart`

#### **2a. CELO Payments**
**Flow:**
1. Fetches real CELO balance from blockchain
2. Validates sufficient balance + gas fees (0.002 CELO buffer)
3. Calls `ContractService.payWithCELO()`
4. Sends CELO as `msg.value` with transaction
5. PaymentProcessor transfers to merchant
6. Returns transaction hash

**Smart Contract Call:**
```dart
contractService.payWithCELO(
  privateKeyHex: privateKey,
  merchantAddress: "0x742d35Cc...",
  amount: 0.1,
  note: "Payment for coffee",
)
```

**Contract Function:**
```solidity
function payWithCELO(
    address _merchant, 
    string memory _note
) external payable
```

**Verification:** ‚úÖ CELO sent as `msg.value`, direct transfer to merchant

#### **2b. cUSD Payments** ‚ö†Ô∏è **FIXED**
**Flow:**
1. Fetches real cUSD balance from blockchain
2. Validates sufficient CELO for gas (0.002 CELO)
3. **NEW:** Approves PaymentProcessor to spend cUSD (ERC20 approval)
4. Waits 2 seconds for approval transaction to mine
5. Calls `ContractService.payWithCUSD()`
6. PaymentProcessor uses `transferFrom()` to move cUSD
7. Returns transaction hash

**Smart Contract Call:**
```dart
// Step 1: Approve
cUSDContract.approve(
  paymentProcessorAddress,
  amountInWei
)

// Step 2: Payment
contractService.payWithCUSD(
  privateKeyHex: privateKey,
  merchantAddress: "0x742d35Cc...",
  amount: 10.0,
  note: "Payment for coffee",
)
```

**Contract Function:**
```solidity
function payWithCUSD(
    address _merchant,
    uint256 _amount,
    string memory _note
) external
```

**Critical Fix Applied:** ‚úÖ Added ERC20 approval step before cUSD payment

---

### 3. ‚úÖ **Loan Request** (COMPLETE)
**File:** `lib/features/loan/loan_request_screen.dart`

**Flow:**
1. Fetches credit score from CreditScoreOracle on init
2. Calculates max loan based on score (650 = $500, 800+ = $5000)
3. User enters loan details (amount, term, purpose)
4. Calculates interest rate from credit score (basis points)
5. Calls `ContractService.requestLoan()`
6. Submits to LoanEscrow contract
7. Returns transaction hash
8. Shows success dialog with txHash

**Smart Contract Call:**
```dart
contractService.requestLoan(
  privateKeyHex: privateKey,
  amount: 500.0,           // cUSD
  interestRate: 900,       // 9% APR = 900 basis points
  durationDays: 90,
)
```

**Contract Function:**
```solidity
function requestLoan(
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _interestRate,
    uint256 _durationDays
) external returns (bytes32 loanId)
```

**Verification:** ‚úÖ Parameters match (amount, interestRate, durationDays), transaction signed

---

### 4. ‚úÖ **Loan Marketplace** (COMPLETE)
**File:** `lib/features/marketplace/loan_marketplace_screen.dart`

**Flow:**
1. Calls `ContractService.getPendingLoans()` on init
2. Fetches array of loan IDs from LoanEscrow contract
3. Displays loan ID cards (shows pending loans)
4. Pull-to-refresh enabled
5. Shows empty state if no loans

**Smart Contract Call:**
```dart
final loanIds = await contractService.getPendingLoans();
// Returns: ["0x1a2b3c...", "0x4d5e6f...", ...]
```

**Contract Function:**
```solidity
function getPendingLoans() external view returns (bytes32[] memory)
```

**Limitation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Contract doesn't have `getLoanDetails(loanId)` function yet. Currently shows loan IDs only.

**TODO:** Add this to LoanEscrow.sol:
```solidity
function getLoanDetails(bytes32 loanId) 
    external 
    view 
    returns (
        address borrower,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interestRate,
        uint256 durationDays,
        LoanStatus status
    )
```

---

### 5. ‚úÖ **Credit Score Display** (COMPLETE)
**File:** `lib/features/credit_score/credit_score_detail_screen.dart`

**Flow:**
1. Fetches on-chain credit score from CreditScoreOracle
2. Shows loading state while fetching
3. Displays on-chain score in app bar badge
4. Shows "Blockchain Verified" indicator
5. Displays breakdown components (uses mock data for now)

**Smart Contract Call:**
```dart
final score = await contractService.getCreditScore(merchantAddress);
// Returns: 750 (or null if not set)
```

**Contract Function:**
```solidity
function getCreditScore(address _merchant) 
    external 
    view 
    returns (
        uint256 score,
        uint256 lastUpdated,
        bool exists
    )
```

**Limitation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Breakdown calculation requires transaction history from blockchain events (TODO)

---

## üîß Supporting Services

### **Web3Service** (`lib/core/services/web3_service.dart`)
- Fetches real CELO, cUSD, cEUR balances from blockchain
- Uses Celo Alfajores RPC
- Returns balances in human-readable format (not Wei)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Fixes Applied

### **Issue 1: cUSD Payments Failed** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** PaymentProcessor uses `transferFrom()` which requires approval  
**Solution:** Added 2-step process:
1. Approve PaymentProcessor to spend cUSD
2. Call payWithCUSD

### **Issue 2: "Cannot pay yourself" Error** ‚úÖ DOCUMENTED
**Problem:** User tried to pay their own address  
**Solution:** 
- Manual payment screen shows test merchant address
- Displays warning: "You CANNOT send payment to your own address!"
- Provides test address: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb1`

### **Issue 3: Insufficient Funds for Gas** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** User didn't account for gas fees  
**Solution:**
- Added gas checking before transaction
- CELO payments: amount + 0.002 CELO buffer
- Token payments: 0.002 CELO for gas
- Better error messages with faucet link

## üìù Remaining TODOs (Future Enhancements)

1. **Add getLoanDetails() to LoanEscrow contract**
   - Currently marketplace only shows loan IDs
   - Need full loan details (borrower, amount, rate, duration, status)

2. **Implement transaction history parsing**
   - Parse PaymentProcessor events from blockchain
   - Calculate credit score breakdown from real data
   - Show transaction history in merchant dashboard

3. **Add loan funding functionality**
   - Lenders can fund loans from marketplace
   - Call LoanEscrow.fundLoan()

4. **Implement loan repayment**
   - Borrowers can repay loans
   - Auto-repayment from incoming payments

5. **Update credit score oracle**
   - Only contract owner can update scores
   - Need admin function or automated oracle
