# Project Reset Complete ✅

Your CeloCred Flutter project has been successfully reset to a clean starting state!

## What Was Done

### ✅ Removed Custom Code
- Deleted `lib/core/` directory (services, models, constants)
- Deleted `lib/features/` directory (wallet, payment, scanner screens)
- Removed `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` and `SETUP.md` documentation files

### ✅ Reset to Fresh State
- `lib/main.dart` - Reset to default Flutter counter app
- `README.md` - Updated with clean project description
- `test/widget_test.dart` - Kept as is (tests the counter app)

### ✅ Preserved Essential Files
All Flutter project structure and Celo-related dependencies are intact:

**Dependencies (from pubspec.yaml):**
- ✅ `web3dart: ^2.7.3` - Blockchain interaction
- ✅ `walletconnect_flutter_v2: ^2.3.9` - WalletConnect protocol
- ✅ `flutter_secure_storage: ^9.2.4` - Secure storage
- ✅ `mobile_scanner: ^7.1.3` - QR code scanning
- ✅ `qr_flutter: ^4.1.0` - QR code generation
- ✅ `http: ^1.5.0` - HTTP requests
- ✅ `url_launcher: ^6.3.2` - URL handling

## Current Status

- ✅ **Dependencies installed** - All packages downloaded
- ✅ **No errors** - Project compiles successfully
- ✅ **Ready to build** - Can run on any device
- ✅ **Memory optimized** - Android Gradle set to 1.5GB (works on your PC)

## Next Steps - When Ready to Build

### 1. Test Basic App
```bash
flutter run
```
This will run the default counter app to verify everything works.

### 2. Start Building Your Celo App
You can now build your Celo payment app from scratch with all the essential tools ready:
- Blockchain interaction (web3dart)
- Secure storage (flutter_secure_storage)
- QR scanning (mobile_scanner)
- WalletConnect support

### 3. Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Run on your phone (remember to connect via USB)
flutter devices
flutter run -d RZ8N71FJHBZ

# Create a new screen
# Just create files in lib/ folder

# Hot reload (while app is running)
# Press 'r' in terminal

# Hot restart (while app is running)
# Press 'R' in terminal

# Stop app
# Press 'q' in terminal
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Physical Device Recommended**: Your PC has limited RAM, so using your Samsung Galaxy M01 (device ID: `RZ8N71FJHBZ`) works perfectly for testing.

⚠️ **First Build Takes Time**: First build takes 5-6 minutes, subsequent hot reloads take ~30 seconds.

✅ **All Dependencies Ready**: You don't need to reinstall packages - everything needed for Celo development is already configured.

**You're all set!** The project is now in a clean state, ready for you to start building your Celo mobile payment app whenever you want. All the tools you need are already installed and configured.
