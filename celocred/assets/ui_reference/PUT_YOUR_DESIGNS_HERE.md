# UI Reference Folder

Put your UI design mockups and reference images here!

## What to Put Here:
- Screenshots of designs you want me to implement
- Figma/Adobe XD exports
- Hand-drawn sketches (photos)
- Reference apps screenshots
- Color palette images
- Any visual reference for the app design

## Example Files:
- `home_screen.png` - Home screen design
- `payment_flow.png` - Payment screen design
- `wallet_view.png` - Wallet screen design
- `color_scheme.png` - Colors you want to use
- `full_app_design.pdf` - Complete app design document

## How I'll Use Them:
1. You upload design images here
2. Tell me "Build the home screen based on the UI reference"
3. I'll look at your design and implement it in Flutter code
4. You get the exact UI you want!

## Tips:
- Name files clearly (e.g., "login_screen_design.png")
- Include annotations if needed (arrows, notes)
- Multiple angles/states are helpful (normal, pressed, error states)
