celocred/
└── assets/
    ├── logo/              ← Put your app logo here
    ├── images/            ← Put general app images here
    └── ui_reference/      ← Put UI design mockups here
```

## 🎨 Where to Put Your Files

### 1. **Your App Logo** 
📍 **Location:** `assets/logo/`

Put your logo image file here. For example:
- `app_logo.png`
- `celocred_logo.png`
- `logo.png`

**How I'll use it in code:**
```dart
Image.asset('assets/logo/app_logo.png')
```

---

### 2. **UI Design References** (For me to see and build from)
📍 **Location:** `assets/ui_reference/`

Put screenshots or images of how you want the app to look. For example:
- `home_screen_design.png` - Your home screen design
- `payment_screen_mockup.jpg` - Payment screen design
- `full_app_ui.png` - Complete app design
- `color_palette.png` - Colors you want

**How you'll tell me to use them:**
> "Build the home screen based on the design in ui_reference"
> "Check ui_reference/payment_screen_design.png and create that screen"

---

### 3. **General App Images**
📍 **Location:** `assets/images/`

Any other images you want to use in the app:
- Icons
- Background images
- Graphics
- Illustrations

## 💡 Quick Example

## 📝 Tips for Best Results

### For Logo:
- ✅ PNG format (supports transparency)
- ✅ At least 512x512 pixels (higher is better)
- ✅ Transparent background recommended
- ✅ Square aspect ratio (1:1)

### For UI References:
- ✅ Clear, high-resolution screenshots
- ✅ Label them clearly (e.g., "home_screen.png")
- ✅ Can be any format (PNG, JPG, PDF)
- ✅ Multiple screens = multiple files

### For General Images:
- ✅ PNG for images needing transparency
- ✅ JPG for photos (smaller file size)
- ✅ Keep under 1MB per image if possible

## 🎯 What Happens Next?

### After you add your logo:
Tell me: *"I've added my logo as [filename], please use it in the app"*
I'll integrate it into the app design!

### After you add UI reference images:
Tell me: *"Check the UI reference folder and build the home screen"*
I'll look at your design and create the exact Flutter code to match it!
