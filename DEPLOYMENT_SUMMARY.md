## 🔄 What Changed

### Smart Contract Improvements

#### **PaymentProcessor.sol** - Enhanced Payment Flexibility
**Problem:** Contract would revert when sending payments to non-merchant addresses (e.g., refunds, personal payments).

**Solution:** Added try-catch logic to check if recipient is a registered merchant before recording transaction stats.

```solidity
// Before: Would fail if recipient wasn't a merchant
merchantRegistry.recordTransaction(_merchant, _amount);

// After: Gracefully handles non-merchant recipients
try merchantRegistry.isMerchant(_merchant) returns (bool isMerchant) {
    if (isMerchant) {
        merchantRegistry.recordTransaction(_merchant, _amount);
    }
} catch {
    // Recipient is not a merchant, skip recording
}
```

**Impact:** 
- ✅ Merchants can now send payments to anyone (customers, suppliers, etc.)
- ✅ Stats still tracked for merchant-to-merchant transactions
- ✅ Enables refund scenarios without contract errors

---

### Flutter App Enhancements

#### **1. Firebase Service** - Bidirectional Transaction Tracking

**File:** `celocred/lib/core/services/firebase_service.dart`

**Changes:**
- `getMerchantTransactions()`: Now queries BOTH `merchantAddress` (received) AND `customerAddress` (sent)
- Each transaction marked with `type` field: `'received'` or `'sent'`
- `getMerchantStats()`: Calculates separate totals for revenue, spending, and net income

**New Stats Returned:**
```dart
{
  'totalRevenue': 1000.0,      // Total received
  'totalSpent': 250.0,         // Total sent
  'netIncome': 750.0,          // Revenue - Spent
  'totalReceived': 45,         // Count of received
  'totalSent': 12,             // Count of sent
  'todayRevenue': 150.0,
  'todaySpent': 50.0,
}
```

#### **2. Merchant Dashboard** - Visual Transaction Indicators

**File:** `celocred/lib/features/merchant/merchant_dashboard_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Transaction list now shows icons based on type:
  - 🟢 **Green ↓** for received payments
  - 🟠 **Orange ↑** for sent payments
- Dynamic text: "Payment Received" or "Payment Sent"
- Shows counterparty address (customer for received, merchant for sent)

**Before:**
```dart
// Only showed received payments with hardcoded icon
Icon(Icons.arrow_downward, color: Colors.green)
Text('Payment Received')
```

**After:**
```dart
// Dynamic icon and text based on transaction type
Icon(icon, color: iconColor)  // icon = received ? ↓ : ↑
Text(type == 'received' ? 'Payment Received' : 'Payment Sent')
```

#### **3. QR Scanner** - Smart Merchant Verification

**File:** `celocred/lib/features/payment/qr_scanner_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Parses QR code format: `celocred:merchant:BusinessName:0xAddress`
- Also supports plain wallet addresses: `0xAddress`
- Verifies merchant on blockchain using `ContractService.isMerchant()`
- Fetches merchant details from blockchain before navigation
- Shows error if address is not a registered merchant

**Flow:**
```
Scan QR → Parse Data → Verify on Blockchain → Get Merchant Details → Navigate to Payment
```

**Error Handling:**
- Invalid QR format → Show error message
- Not a registered merchant → Show warning, navigate to manual payment
- Blockchain error → Show error, allow retry

## ✅ Testing Results

### Contract Tests (15/15 Passing)

```
✅ Merchant Registration
✅ Merchant Details Retrieval
✅ Customer→Merchant Payment (RECEIVED)
✅ Transaction Recording in Registry
✅ Payment History Tracking
✅ Merchant→Customer Payment (SENT)
✅ Bidirectional Transaction Tracking
✅ Credit Score Updates
✅ Credit Score Validation
✅ Loan Request
✅ Loan Funding
✅ Loan Repayment
✅ QR Merchant Verification
✅ Non-Merchant Address Rejection
✅ Dashboard Statistics Integration
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Bidirectional payments (merchant as sender AND receiver)
- ✅ QR code merchant verification
- ✅ Transaction history for both parties
- ✅ Dashboard statistics (revenue, spending, net income)
- ✅ Credit score management
- ✅ Loan lifecycle (request, fund, repay)

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **ReentrancyGuard**: Both PaymentProcessor and LoanEscrow use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
2. **Ownable**: Admin functions restricted to contract owner
3. **Try-Catch**: Graceful handling of external contract calls
4. **Input Validation**: All parameters validated before processing
5. **Safe Transfers**: Using SafeERC20 patterns for token transfers

## 📊 Gas Usage

| Function | Estimated Gas |
|----------|---------------|
| Register Merchant | ~150,000 |
| Payment (cUSD) | ~80,000 |
| Payment (CELO) | ~50,000 |
| Request Loan | ~120,000 |
| Fund Loan | ~90,000 |
| Repay Loan | ~100,000 |
| Update Credit Score | ~60,000 |

**Note:** Gas costs on Celo are significantly lower than Ethereum mainnet due to Celo's ultra-light client and stable gas fees.
